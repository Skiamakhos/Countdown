# Countdown
This is a slight adaptation of Daniel Tebbut's Countdown solver (found here: http://danieltebbutt.com/countdown/countdown.java) to take a CSV file input, for a technical test I'm doing for a job. Maths & algorithms aren't my strong point, but I'm pretty good at adapting stuff other people have done for my nefarious purposes. Kudos to Daniel for his sterling code!
